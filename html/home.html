        <h1>Electric Hole In The Wall</h1>
        <p>Our inspiration to create this game came from popular comedy Japanese TV Show "Hole In the Wall." The goal of the game is to use charge clumps to "move" a charged object to a hole (mirroring ths show, in which participants have to contort their bodies to fit an outline within a short period of time). The primary physics principle used is Coulomb's law.</p>

        <p>You will have the option to choose between three modes of difficulty: EASY (relatively simple object with no barriers), MEDIUM (relativelt simple object with barriers randomly scattered), and HARD ( complex shapes and barriers). In addition to difficulty levels, there will be the option to choose between a ZEN and TIMED mode, with the former featuring an infinite number of levels and no time limit, and the latter having a finite number of levels to be completed in a set time limit.</p>
