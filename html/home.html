        <h1>Electric Hole In The Wall</h1>
        <p>Our inspiration to create this game came from popular comedy Japanese TV Show "Hole In the Wall," in which the goal of the game is to use charged clumps to move a charged object to a hole (mirroring the show, in which participants have to contort their bodies to fit an outline within a short period of time). The primary physics principle used is Coulomb's law.</p>

        <p>You will have the option to choose between three modes of difficulty: EASY (relatively simple object with no barriers), MEDIUM (relatively simple object with barriers randomly scattered), and HARD (complex shapes and barriers).</p>
        <p>In addition to difficulty levels, there will be the option to choose between a ZEN and TIMED mode, with the former featuring an infinite number of levels and no time limit, and the latter having a finite number of levels to be completed in a set time limit.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, there will be an option to adjust the hole's dimensions relative to the object (default will be 1.1x object's dimensions) to make it easier/harder to achieve the objective.</p>
        <p>We can also add random charge distributions to the objects to narrow down the ways to achieve the objective.</p>
        <p>You will also have the option to adjust the TIMED mode to SLOW, NORMAL, and QUICK to increase or decrease difficulty.</p>
